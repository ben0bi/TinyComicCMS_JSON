# TinyComicCMS_JSON

"Fork" of TinyComicCMS on github.com/ben0bi

Hopefully the most tiny webcomic CMS and Frontend. 

Not yet running.

JSON Version. No Database is used here. PHP is only used to upload files and
save the JSON-"Database".

Easy PC handling: Use left and right arrow keys to get previous or next post.  
-> Title beneath the mouse when over image.

Support for Tablets and Smartphones:  
-> Swipe to the left or right on the image to load the next or previous post.  
-> Title in top-left of image when touching.  

Blog function:  
-> Each post can have several "blog" entries.  
This blog is actually only for the creator, there is no commenting function right now.

Where is the administration login link?    
-> In the lower right corner is a "Source"-link. You will find the admin link there on the "Archives" page.
