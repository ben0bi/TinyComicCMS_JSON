This file explains how I converted the old SQL database to the new JSON database.

There are multiple converters because this was a work in progress. I did the one after another while rewriting the core engine.
Sorry for that. I hope you can convert your old databases, though.

1. Extract your SQL:
	1. Export it from PHPMyAdmin as SQL file.
	2. Open that file and search for the image and blog entries.
	3. Go through each entry and press enter on the end of it. It's all in one line but the converter looks for enters. Save it.
	4. Name it starforce.sql and use "python 1convert.py"
		It has a little menu: Press enter to do nothing or 1 or 2 to add the line to the image or blog db. Press 3 to get the save menu.
		Don't forget to save your dbs after you went through all the entries. Both DBs reside in their own file.

2. Convert special characters:
	5. Use the 2sqltextconverter.js to reset the special characters from the old db. You need to provide the proper filename and use it twice.
		Save the output on the browser.

3. "Convert" the pageorder:
	6. Use the 3pageorderconverter.js to sort the image db by pageorder and then remove the pageorder property.
